# Watch and balance parity baseline

`oracle.json` is generated from the unchanged Python reference modules in
`reference/`. It contains compact cross-language vectors for
the behavior that the Go port must preserve: key and descriptor conversion,
helper formatting, provisioning RPC sequences, balance states, persisted wallet
CRUD, and balance history.

The Python code is a frozen test reference, not a production dependency. The
production image contains only the Go dashboard. The retained suite has 131
Python assertions, and `test_http.py` runs the same 14 public HTTP contracts
against both the reference server and the production Go binary.

Regenerate or verify it from the repository root:

```sh
python3 build/dashboard/parity/generate.py --write
python3 build/dashboard/parity/generate.py --check
```

The existing Python tests remain the detailed source of truth. The baseline at
commit `b530e7e1ebb50924d5c41ab2f53bc8911f05a014` was recorded with:

```sh
python3 -m pytest -q build/dashboard/tests/test_watch.py build/dashboard/tests/test_balance_history.py
python3 -m coverage run --branch -m pytest -q build/dashboard/tests/test_watch.py build/dashboard/tests/test_balance_history.py
python3 -m coverage report -m build/dashboard/parity/reference/watch.py build/dashboard/parity/reference/balance_history.py
```

Result: 39 tests passed. Branch coverage was 94% for `watch.py`, 100% for
`balance_history.py`, and 95% combined. Source and test hashes are recorded in
`baseline.json`.

The Go runtime deliberately tightens two legacy behaviors: wallet mutations and nonempty wallet views require a configured dashboard password, and descriptors containing private keys are rejected before persistence. Existing private-bearing roster files are secured, preserved, hidden from the API, and locked against changes until the operator removes the private material out of band. Basic status remains available without a password for the documented LAN-only setup.
